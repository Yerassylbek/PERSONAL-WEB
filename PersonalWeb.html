    <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">WHAT I LOVE BOTTOM TO DO!?</h1>
    <p style="position: relative; left: 3%;width: 97%;"> Every person has their own preferences and hobbies. Some do not need anything else, let them sit at the computer and flip through the Internet. Some people enjoy reading books and magazines. And he no longer hears or sees anything around him, he is busy with an interesting plot of the work. And some people just like to walk in the yard with friends and comrades. I personally have a lot of things I love that I can do with great pleasure.
    Strange as it may seem for a young man, I really like to spend a lot of my free time with my big family. It is very interesting for me to talk with my dad, you can ask him about everything, and for any question I will definitely get an exhaustive answer. He knows a lot of things, I also want to be literate and knowledgeable. With my mother, we can spend the whole day off in the kitchen. I really love to cook, especially if it's something new. Mom and I love to experiment and try to cook different dishes from different cuisines of the world. To do this, we specially go to the store, choose the products needed in the recipe. How nice it is to surprise everyone with a new dish after cooking. Usually we try to decorate it very nicely and present it on the table in beautiful dishes.
    Another of my favorite things to do is spending time with my sister. She is still very young, she is only two years old. But she's already so funny and curious. It is imperative to watch her constantly so that she does not have time to "naughty" anywhere. Her curiosity knows no bounds, everywhere she must check everything, look through all the lockers that she can reach. Mom even tied some of the doors crosswise with an elastic band so that my youngest beauty could not open them.
    But the most, perhaps, favorite pastime is the departure of our whole family to nature. We try to do this more often. The whole friendly company we load into the car, in the trunk of which there is marinated meat for barbecue, a whole bag with vegetables, fruits and other food, plus a separate box for the sister's provisions. Not far, just a few kilometers from the city, there is a very beautiful place where we come on a weekend. Dad immediately gives us all an assignment to collect dry branches for a fire, he puts a table and chairs in the meadow himself, mom sets the table. At this time, my sister and grandma are exploring the neighborhood, picking flowers and berries. While we are "whetting" our appetite, dad has already cooked a barbecue and we all sit down in our seats, completely ready for such a pleasant meal. There is no need to invent anything here, everything is already very tasty. Fresh air, relatives nearby, what else do you need? While I am not yet very grown up, I enjoy being with my family. I know that soon this will not happen, I will leave to study in another city, and therefore I take advantage of the moment.</p>
